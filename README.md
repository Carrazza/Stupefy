    This is a software made with Python3 without any means to profit.

    Developed by two Computer Science students at UFSCAR - Sorocaba for the HackerSpace extension activity, the point of this was to understand and apply some abilities gathered along the course until the present moment this package is released.

    The first version provides only a way to convert Spotify playlists to YouTube ones, using both Spotify and YouTube API's. We, as
young developers, hope you enjoy this simple project and use it with care. This was a project made for fun and knowledge only and we hope you can have some fun with it too. 

#Enjoy your music!
